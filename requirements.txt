# NYC Taxi Deep Learning Pipeline

End-to-end deep learning pipeline for analyzing NYC Yellow Taxi trip data, featuring comprehensive data exploration and neural network regression models.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes 2M+ NYC Yellow Taxi trip records from 2020, implementing a complete machine learning workflow from exploratory data analysis to building production-ready regression models for trip duration prediction.

## 🚀 Pipeline Components

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Preprocessing
**Notebook:** `01_exploratory_analysis.ipynb`

- Processed 2M+ NYC taxi trip records (January-May 2020)
- Comprehensive data cleaning: missing values, outliers, type conversions
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis
- TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) for automated data quality checks
- COVID-19 impact analysis on taxi industry patterns (March 2020)
- Statistical analysis and visualization

**Key Insights:**
- Identified key features affecting trip duration
- Discovered anomalies in data during pandemic onset
- Created cleaned dataset ready for modeling

### Phase 2: Neural Network Regression Models
**Notebook:** `02_regression_models.ipynb`

- Integrated NYC weather data for enhanced predictions
- Built and compared three architectures:
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
  - **Linear Regression** (Keras Sequential, no hidden layers)
  - **Deep Neural Network** (DNN with 2+ hidden layers)
- Optimizer comparison: SGD, Adam, RMSProp
- Loss functions: MSE and MAE
- 80/20 train-validation split with 100 epochs
- TensorBoard visualization for training monitoring

**Model Performance:**
- Compared multiple optimizers and learning rates
- Selected best model based on validation loss
- Achieved production-ready prediction accuracy
